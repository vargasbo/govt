## Amendment 29: Balanced Federal Budget with Debt Repayment

**Section 1: A Debt-Free America**  
The United States shall balance its federal budget each year, with outlays not exceeding revenues, as certified by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) using standard accounting principles, and fully eliminate the $37 trillion national debt by 2065, restoring trust and securing prosperity for all Americans.

**Section 2: Debt Repayment Mandate**  
1. Congress shall achieve annual budget surpluses of at least 1% of GDP by 2030, applied to reduce the national debt until fully repaid by 2065.  
2. A Federal Reserve Fund, built from surplus revenues, shall prioritize debt repayment and emergency needs, ensuring fiscal responsibility.

**Section 3: Exceptions for Crisis**  
1. Deficit spending is permitted only during a declared war (per Article I, Section 8) or a national pandemic (confirmed by a two-thirds vote of Congress and the CDC). Deficits shall end 90 days after active combat or pandemic status ceases, unless extended by a three-fourths vote of both Houses.  
2. All spending, including for national security, infrastructure, technology, or energy, shall be funded within the balanced budget or Federal Reserve Fund, prohibiting any deficit-financed investments.

**Section 4: Safeguarding Trust Funds**  
The Social Security Trust Fund, Medicare Trust Fund, and other designated funds are inviolable. Borrowing from them requires a three-fourths vote of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of states within 60 days. Interest on existing trust fund investments shall be at market rates, as set by the CBO.

**Section 5: Swift and Transparent Accounting**  
1. The CBO shall issue a preliminary budget and debt repayment compliance report within 30 days of the fiscal year’s end, followed by a final report within 60 days, both public and detailing all expenditures.  
2. The Federal Reserve Fund and trust funds shall face annual public audits to ensure integrity.

**Section 6: Accountability with Teeth**  
If the budget is unbalanced outside exceptions, debt repayment targets are missed, trust funds are misused, or reports are late, all House and Senate members serving during the budget’s enactment shall be permanently ineligible for any public office. CBO findings are final unless unanimously overturned by the Supreme Court within 30 days.

**Section 7: No Loopholes**  
No accounting tricks or off-budget schemes may evade this amendment. All spending, including emergencies, counts unless exempted. Congress shall implement this within one year, with the amendment effective two fiscal years after ratification.

## Amendment 30: Anti-Gerrymandering with State County Rules

**Section 1**  
Congressional and state legislative districts shall be drawn by a neutral algorithm, modeled on state county boundary principles, prioritizing compactness, county and municipal line integrity, and proximity to administrative centers (e.g., county seats). Districts shall have equal population, with a 1% maximum deviation.

**Section 2**  
1. A nonpartisan federal commission, appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, shall create a public, reviewable redistricting algorithm.  
2. The algorithm shall maximize compactness, minimize boundary splits, center districts on administrative hubs, and exclude political data (e.g., voting history, incumbent addresses).  
3. States may propose compliant algorithms, subject to commission approval.

**Section 3**  
Redistricting occurs every 10 years post-census, with maps certified within 18 months. States may not alter maps except for legal compliance. Citizens may challenge maps in federal court, with courts empowered to order redraws.

**Section 4**  
This amendment applies to elections after the first post-ratification redistricting. Congress and states may enforce via legislation, subject to judicial review.

**Section 2: Prohibition on Profiteering**  
1. States, courts (including criminal, civil, and family courts), police, jails, prisons, or related entities are prohibited from receiving revenue, fees, fines, or other financial benefits, directly or indirectly, from arrests, prosecutions, convictions, incarceration, civil disputes, or family proceedings, including through private contracts, civil asset forfeiture, quotas, or excessive fees charged to inmates or their families for food, communication, or other services.  
2. Any fines, fees, or seized assets shall be redirected exclusively to a state victim compensation fund, not to operational budgets, private entities, or any other use.  
3. Funding for justice system operations, including criminal, civil, and family courts, jails, and prisons, shall come solely from general state or local revenues, appropriated transparently and without profit incentives.

**Section 3: Enforcement and Accountability**  
1. The Department of Justice (DOJ) shall audit state and local justice systems, including criminal, civil, and family courts, jails, and prisons, annually, issuing public reports within 60 days of the fiscal year’s end to certify compliance and identify profit-driven practices.  
2. Any state official, judge, law enforcement officer, or jail/prison official found to have facilitated profit-driven justice practices, including excessive fees, shall be permanently ineligible for public office or employment in any justice system, as determined by expedited federal court review within 30 days.

**Section 2: Enforcement and Accountability**  
1. If the Senate fails to hold a vote within 60 days, the Senate Majority Leader and Minority Leader shall be permanently ineligible for any public office, as determined by expedited federal court review within 30 days.

**Section 3: Implementation**

They limit congressional terms to keep power accountable, erase $37 trillion in debt by 2065 while protecting Social Security, ensure fair elections through neutral redistricting, end profit-driven justice in courts and jails, and guarantee timely Senate votes on nominees. Together, they restore trust and build a prosperous, just future for all.
